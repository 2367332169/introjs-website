Product tours play a significant role in **user onboarding**. The goal of product tours is to make people fall in love with your product or feature. You guide them through this process persuade them to take action. These tours take your product onboarding experience to the next level. 

Product tours can result in the user to get their _"aha moment."_ An aha moment is when a user finally decides to take positive action after learning the benefits of your product or feature. If done wrong, product tours can be a major disappointment and a waste of time. That is why we have brought you five of the best tips to increase the success rate of your product tours. 

But before that, let us take a short course through the benefits you get from these tours.

## Why do You Need Product Tours?

The best thing you get out of your product tours is getting the aha moment. The moment they realize why your product or software would make their life better, your life would get better too. Not everyone is willing to discover this moment all by themselves. That's when product tours jump into the frame. They help users find out the true value of your product step-by-step and then make them take action. You can easily use tools available on the web to experiment on which product tour approach suits you best. 

## How Can You Make Your Product Tours Better?

### 1. Basics
The number one rule you should always remember when designing product tours is to focus on the priorities. The basic features of your product should come into the picture first. The advanced features come later. There's a chance that users might not need all of your advanced features. If you present them first, the user's interest will go right out the window, and they wouldn't finish the tour. Hence, focus on the order of the messages you would be conveying. Present the basics first, and the best parts come later on.

### 2. Analytics
Keeping a record of your marketing practices greatly helps you improve your tactics. If you can't measure your actions, then you won't know if you're even making progress. Use analytics to calculate the engagements of the users. If a user starts the tour but leaves in the middle, it means that you need to work on that part, which they found boring or uninteresting. Experiment and see which parts of your tours need more improvement. Never stop using tracking tools to determine your progress. There are always ways to improve.

### 3. Concise
Concise and sharp information being displayed is the most important law of marketing. Nobody likes an information overload with no direction whatsoever. Your goal is to present the product and enlist its benefits. There is no need to go into useless detail about competition or history. Focus on quality instead of quantity. Decrease the number of steps in the tour and make them straightforward. It is no lie that beginner users need more guidance. But your audience is more likely to be a mix of newbies and experienced users. So, design your product tour accordingly, which suits a general audience.

### 4. Visuals
If you can get your hands on high-quality visuals that present your idea, the chances of users getting their aha moment increase drastically. Everyone likes colorful visuals and pretty display. Using animations and eye-catching designs in your tour will make the users stick around till the end. You can also present yourself talking about the product yourself. Folks are more likely to buy something when they see emotions and feelings displayed in the message.
 
### 5. Start and End

Your product tour should start with a sharp and straightforward definition of whatever you're selling. Do not give all of the info away at the start. Rather prioritize your ideas throughout the tour. Present a brief intro that would make users stick throughout the tour. Build up for the advanced features they'll get and hype it up a little. This would help users staying engaged till the end of the tour. In the end, drop the most compelling reasons and persuade users into believing how their lives would be better with your product. End your tour with a sharp call-to-action and thank them for taking the time out to go through your tour.

## The Bottom Line
If done the right way, product tours can do wonders in attracting interest from users. All you have to do is to keep the above-mentioned tips in mind while designing and never stop improving.
