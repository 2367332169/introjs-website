A **user onboarding experience** is a crucial process that determines an important outcome. This process is basically designed for users to go through a responsive guide about a product or software. In a user onboarding experience, a user gets to find out the benefits of the product they’ll be getting. The goal of these programs is to encourage users to opt for a product. Call it an automated form of marketing, but user onboarding experiences can help a user bond with your product or software. It also doesn’t stop after giving the user an overview of the particular product, instead, the user then gets to give their feedback about their overall experience.

The reason you need onboarding experiences is **to make users acquainted with your product in no time**. These experiences help users understand the ins and outs of the product so that they don’t have to figure these out themselves. You can build a special bond between you and your prospect through these guides and then form a relationship of trust. Not only would your product get the attention that it deserves, but you’ll also get more opportunities to shine later on.

To ensure your onboarding experience goes smooth, you need to structure it in the best way possible. The following best practices are described to eliminate any possibility of your user onboarding experience going south.

## 1. First Impression.
The landing page is what decides the first impression a user gets from their experience. Make sure you make this page perfect. It should be intriguing enough to keep the user engaged and permanently catch their undivided attention. Use a straightforward title that represents your product in the best way with aesthetically pleasing visuals surrounding it. This way the user would know that they’re in for a treat and would be interested in moving forward with their user onboarding experience.

## 2. Short and Sharp.
Once the first impression gets over with, now the main body of the onboarding comes into the frame. You must structure the main info to be short yet detailed. The walkthrough should consist of sharp sentences and easy to understand information. A complicated and difficult walkthrough is something nobody would want to go through. Your goal should be to convey a heavy but short message. Do not go into unnecessary details. Rather focus on the core aspect of your product and structure your walkthrough around it.

## 3. Responsive.
To keep the user engaged and interested, make your onboarding experience responsive. Make the user answer some short questions throughout the process. Or make them feel important by asking them to carry out small tasks. You can also ask for feedback indirectly through this process. However, make sure not to overdo it. Your goal is to keep the user engaged, not to make them do everything. This would result in the user thinking of the onboarding experience as a realistic approach instead of just a robot doing marketing.

## Conclusion
Your goal is to build a bond with the user. Ensure you get feedback either throughout the walkthrough or at the end of it. You might get a negative one but take that as good news. The ability to know where you made a mistake is a blessing. You can use that to structure your onboarding experience in a much better way. The key is to ever stop improving or learning!
