This process is basically designed for users to go through a responsive guide about a product or software. In a user onboarding experience, a user gets to find out the benefits of the product they’ll be getting. The goal of these programs is to encourage users to opt for a product. Call it an automated form of marketing, but user onboarding experiences can help a user bond with your product or software. It also doesn’t stop after giving the user an overview of the particular product, instead, the user then gets to give their feedback about their overall experience.</p><p>The reason you need onboarding experiences is <strong>to make users acquainted with your product in no time</strong>. These experiences help users understand the ins and outs of the product so that they don’t have to figure these out themselves. You can build a special bond between you and your prospect through these guides and then form a relationship of trust. Not only would your product get the attention that it deserves, but you’ll also get more opportunities to shine later on.</p><p>To ensure your onboarding experience goes smooth, you need to structure it in the best way possible. The following best practices are described to eliminate any possibility of your user onboarding experience going south.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="1-first-impression"></a>1. First Impression.<a class="hash-link" href="#1-first-impression" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The landing page is what decides the first impression a user gets from their experience. Make sure you make this page perfect. It should be intriguing enough to keep the user engaged and permanently catch their undivided attention. Use a straightforward title that represents your product in the best way with aesthetically pleasing visuals surrounding it. This way the user would know that they’re in for a treat and would be interested in moving forward with their user onboarding experience.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="2-short-and-sharp"></a>2. Short and Sharp.<a class="hash-link" href="#2-short-and-sharp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Once the first impression gets over with, now the main body of the onboarding comes into the frame. You must structure the main info to be short yet detailed. The walkthrough should consist of sharp sentences and easy to understand information. A complicated and difficult walkthrough is something nobody would want to go through. Your goal should be to convey a heavy but short message. Do not go into unnecessary details. Rather focus on the core aspect of your product and structure your walkthrough around it.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="3-responsive"></a>3. Responsive.<a class="hash-link" href="#3-responsive" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To keep the user engaged and interested, make your onboarding experience responsive. Make the user answer some short questions throughout the process. Or make them feel important by asking them to carry out small tasks. You can also ask for feedback indirectly through this process. However, make sure not to overdo it. Your goal is to keep the user engaged, not to make them do everything. This would result in the user thinking of the onboarding experience as a realistic approach instead of just a robot doing marketing.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Your goal is to build a bond with the user. Ensure you get feedback either throughout the walkthrough or at the end of it. You might get a negative one but take that as good news. The ability to know where you made a mistake is a blessing. You can use that to structure your onboarding experience in a much better way. The key is to ever stop improving or learning!</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/tour">tour</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/onboarding">onboarding</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/product-tour">product-tour</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about How to Structure a Successful User Onboarding Experience" href="/blog/how-to-structure-a-successful-user-onboarding-experience"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_1mse"><a href="/blog/ways-to-increase-the-free-trial-conversion-rate">5 Ways to Increase the Free Trial Conversion Rate</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-12-06T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_3bQP">December 6, 2020  · 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/afshinm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/314326?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Afshin Mehrabani"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/afshinm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Afshin Mehrabani</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Author of Intro.js</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>A <strong>free trial</strong> is sort of a short-lived experience that a consumer gets of your product or service. The goal of this free trial is to encourage the user to buy the product you&#x27;re selling. Free trials are conducted to give users a short or small taste of whatever you&#x27;re selling. This can potentially spark interest in the consumer&#x27;s mind and make them interested in your product or feature. If done correctly, free trials can help you get customers on your side and even get your word out there in public.  </p><p>These trials can last from 3 to 30 days. It depends on the product type mostly. The more time is given to users in free trials, the more features the product usually has. The time period should be just right. Enough for the user to explore all of the features and benefits of the software or product with no rush.</p><p>There are tons of ways to ensure <strong>free trials help users convert</strong>. But the top five most effective ways to increase the free trial conversion rate are described below.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="1-help-users-explore-features"></a>1. Help Users Explore Features<a class="hash-link" href="#1-help-users-explore-features" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The first thing users need in free trials is guidance. Don&#x27;t leave them all alone to figure features out. Rather guide them through the trial through onboarding experiences and let them explore the benefits that your product offers. Give them instructions about complicated features and structure a helpful walkthrough to let them have a bright free trial experience with your product.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="2-give-users-what-they-need"></a>2. Give Users What They Need<a class="hash-link" href="#2-give-users-what-they-need" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Personalizing user experience is a great way to convert prospective buyers. Use this approach to fit in the user&#x27;s special needs. This does not mean all you have to do is send emails. Instead, find information about your target audience and see where they need help the most. Once you assist them with their personal needs, they would understand that you genuinely want to make their lives better through your product. Hence, the free trial would most likely succeed.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="3-set-ideal-trial-length"></a>3. Set Ideal Trial Length<a class="hash-link" href="#3-set-ideal-trial-length" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Setting the perfect trial length is also something most developers screw up with. The trial length should have to be just long enough for the user to explore all of the product&#x27;s features. If it&#x27;s too short, the user won&#x27;t be fully satisfied and most likely will not convert. If it&#x27;s too long, then you&#x27;re letting money slide by giving your top features away for a long time without charging for them. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="4-ask-for-feedback"></a>4. Ask for Feedback<a class="hash-link" href="#4-ask-for-feedback" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Feedback is the most important aspect of free trials. The user is experimenting with your product or software. You need their feedback to improve. Always set up a feedback survey at the end of your free trial. Get the necessary info you need about where you need to improve and how was the customer&#x27;s experience. Users would also take you asking for feedback as a sign that you care about fulfilling their needs.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="5-use-analytics"></a>5. Use Analytics<a class="hash-link" href="#5-use-analytics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Using analytics is a great way to improve. Not only can you use this to examine the personal preferences of your target audience, but you can also realize where you need improvement. See which features are mostly ignored by free trial users. Work on these features and make them better. The reason why they don&#x27;t get attention from users could be a fault or a bug. Sort these problems out and convert users through your free trials.</p><p>By opting for these five ways, your free trial conversion rate would most likely spike up. This would also construct a strong bond between you and your prospects, which would only benefit both parties!</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/tour">tour</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/onboarding">onboarding</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/product-tour">product-tour</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/trial-conversion">trial-conversion</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about 5 Ways to Increase the Free Trial Conversion Rate" href="/blog/ways-to-increase-the-free-trial-conversion-rate"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_1mse"><a href="/blog/five-amazing-benefits-of-user-onboarding-you-should-know">Five Amazing Benefits of User Onboarding You Should Know</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-12-06T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_3bQP">December 6, 2020  · 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/afshinm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/314326?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Afshin Mehrabani"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/afshinm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Afshin Mehrabani</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Author of Intro.js</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>Do you know what <strong>user onboarding</strong> is all about? What is the relationship between user onboarding and your product?
When you define user onboarding, it simply guides the new users to quickly and easily find value in your product. Think of it as a small welcoming bridge between acquiring new customers and turning them into happy, loyal ones.
In essence, this is the first point of contact as soon as a user signs up. This eventually makes a huge difference to make a powerful first impression.</p><p></p><center><img src="/img/blog/98b53e7405337f41.png"></center><p></p><p>Today, the majority of users have little patience and little attention span. They will probably lose interest in case your product is complex and confusing to use. It has to be friendly and attractive when they open it for the first time.
This is the moment when user onboarding makes its way into the picture. Let&#x27;s discuss the top 5 benefits of user onboarding you should know about:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="benefit-no-1-onboarding-improves-the-product-adoption"></a>Benefit No 1: Onboarding Improves the Product Adoption<a class="hash-link" href="#benefit-no-1-onboarding-improves-the-product-adoption" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>SaaS is Software As A Service and refers to the software licensing model. It is based on user subscription in terms of monthly or annual payments. The model introduces some latest features to meet the basic needs of new customers and create extra value.
Nevertheless, a user will start using your product after a specific period. User Onboarding guides some new features to fasten the users&#x27; adaptation process easily.
Shortly, all such product tours can also increase the vast opportunity to upsell &amp; upgrade your customers&#x27; existing plans.</p><p>Benefit No 2: Onboarding Users Boost Conversion Rate
Another significant benefit of user onboarding is that it increases the conversion rate. For any SaaS company, the conversion rate is considered to be an essential metric. New customers have been making their purchase decision in less than 1 minute.
During this critical time, you should never leave your potential customers alone. User onboarding tools have been allowing you to increase the conversion rates with little effort. Through a well-designed product tour, you can easily lead your users towards success.</p><p></p><center><img src="/img/blog/34a7040ecb00ed84.jpg"></center><p></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="benefit-no-3-onboarding-educate-the-users-and-boost-retention"></a>Benefit No 3: Onboarding Educate the Users and Boost Retention<a class="hash-link" href="#benefit-no-3-onboarding-educate-the-users-and-boost-retention" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In any SaaS business, an essential element is to educate your users and boost retention. You have to convince the users to continue paying at standard terms.
Paying users will tend to keep paying the subscription fees for various easy to use products. Otherwise, they will start to look for some other alternatives.
Overall, it will increase product usage and retention rate. In short, a well-onboarded user is a happy user, and a happy user is a paying user.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="benefit-no-4-onboarding-increases-customer-engagement"></a>Benefit No 4: Onboarding Increases Customer Engagement<a class="hash-link" href="#benefit-no-4-onboarding-increases-customer-engagement" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>It is not essential to use SaaS tools only for entertainment. These tools use your product because they need to solve something complicated, thanks to your software immediately.
Involvement of User onboarding tools will help you use SaaS tools comfortably. In this way, users will be able to reach their goals quickly and easily.
With the help of user onboarding software, you will display the real product value to users. This plays an important role in a successful user onboarding process. </p><p></p><center><img src="/img/blog/4ba2733ad429bcd3.jpg"></center><p></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="benefit-no-5-onboarding-reduces-customer-support-costs"></a>Benefit No 5: Onboarding Reduces Customer Support Costs<a class="hash-link" href="#benefit-no-5-onboarding-reduces-customer-support-costs" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Customer service officers will answer the same questions so many times related to product usage. This probably takes a significant amount of time.
This is because user onboarding will be giving some helpful tips to all the customers related to how they can use it. In this scenario, the customer support cost will be reduced seriously. To reduce that cost, preparing a reusable onboarding flow is an efficient solution.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="closing-thoughts"></a>Closing Thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#closing-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>User onboarding is the most significant part of the digital user experience. If designed carefully, it can eventually result in the user who is becoming your brand&#x27;s regular user. They make sure they stick around for the long haul.
You can better take some guidance from an expert to know the basics of user onboarding and its value for your product. Make sure you don&#x27;t do it poorly or overlook it. Keep in mind the competition you have today. Do it right, from the start.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/tour">tour</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/onboarding">onboarding</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/product-tour">product-tour</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Five Amazing Benefits of User Onboarding You Should Know" href="/blog/five-amazing-benefits-of-user-onboarding-you-should-know"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_1mse"><a href="/blog/tips-for-more-engaging-product-tours">5 Tips for More Engaging Product Tours</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-12-05T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_3bQP">December 5, 2020  · 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/afshinm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/314326?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Afshin Mehrabani"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/afshinm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Afshin Mehrabani</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Author of Intro.js</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>Product tours play a significant role in <strong>user onboarding</strong>.

That is why we have brought you five of the best tips to increase the success rate of your product tours. </p><p>But before that, let us take a short course through the benefits you get from these tours.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="why-do-you-need-product-tours"></a>Why do You Need Product Tours?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-do-you-need-product-tours" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The best thing you get out of your product tours is getting the aha moment. The moment they realize why your product or software would make their life better, your life would get better too. Not everyone is willing to discover this moment all by themselves. That&#x27;s when product tours jump into the frame. They help users find out the true value of your product step-by-step and then make them take action. You can easily use tools available on the web to experiment on which product tour approach suits you best. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="how-can-you-make-your-product-tours-better"></a>How Can You Make Your Product Tours Better?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-can-you-make-your-product-tours-better" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="1-basics"></a>1. Basics<a class="hash-link" href="#1-basics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The number one rule you should always remember when designing product tours is to focus on the priorities. The basic features of your product should come into the picture first. The advanced features come later. There&#x27;s a chance that users might not need all of your advanced features. If you present them first, the user&#x27;s interest will go right out the window, and they wouldn&#x27;t finish the tour. Hence, focus on the order of the messages you would be conveying. Present the basics first, and the best parts come later on.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="2-analytics"></a>2. Analytics<a class="hash-link" href="#2-analytics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Keeping a record of your marketing practices greatly helps you improve your tactics. If you can&#x27;t measure your actions, then you won&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re even making progress. Use analytics to calculate the engagements of the users. If a user starts the tour but leaves in the middle, it means that you need to work on that part, which they found boring or uninteresting. Experiment and see which parts of your tours need more improvement. Never stop using tracking tools to determine your progress. There are always ways to improve.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="3-concise"></a>3. Concise<a class="hash-link" href="#3-concise" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Concise and sharp information being displayed is the most important law of marketing. Nobody likes an information overload with no direction whatsoever. Your goal is to present the product and enlist its benefits. There is no need to go into useless detail about competition or history. Focus on quality instead of quantity. Decrease the number of steps in the tour and make them straightforward. It is no lie that beginner users need more guidance. But your audience is more likely to be a mix of newbies and experienced users. So, design your product tour accordingly, which suits a general audience.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="4-visuals"></a>4. Visuals<a class="hash-link" href="#4-visuals" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you can get your hands on high-quality visuals that present your idea, the chances of users getting their aha moment increase drastically. Everyone likes colorful visuals and pretty display. Using animations and eye-catching designs in your tour will make the users stick around till the end. You can also present yourself talking about the product yourself. Folks are more likely to buy something when they see emotions and feelings displayed in the message.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="5-start-and-end"></a>5. Start and End<a class="hash-link" href="#5-start-and-end" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Your product tour should start with a sharp and straightforward definition of whatever you&#x27;re selling. Do not give all of the info away at the start. Rather prioritize your ideas throughout the tour. Present a brief intro that would make users stick throughout the tour. Build up for the advanced features they&#x27;ll get and hype it up a little. This would help users staying engaged till the end of the tour. In the end, drop the most compelling reasons and persuade users into believing how their lives would be better with your product. End your tour with a sharp call-to-action and thank them for taking the time out to go through your tour.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="the-bottom-line"></a>The Bottom Line<a class="hash-link" href="#the-bottom-line" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>If done the right way, product tours can do wonders in attracting interest from users. All you have to do is to keep the above-mentioned tips in mind while designing and never stop improving. </p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/tour">tour</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/onboarding">onboarding</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/walkthrough">walkthrough</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about 5 Tips for More Engaging Product Tours" href="/blog/tips-for-more-engaging-product-tours"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Docs</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/">Intro.js</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/getting-started/install">Install</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/getting-started/start">Quick Start</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/intro.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/usablica" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/usablica/intro.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="text--center"><div>Copyright © 2020 Usablica Limited</div></div></div></footer></div>
