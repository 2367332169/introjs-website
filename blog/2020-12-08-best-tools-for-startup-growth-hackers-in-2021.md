What makes a startup fail in most cases soon after it commences? The answer is **not making its presence known in the required amount of time**. That's when growth hacking comes into the picture. Growth hacking has been around for over a decade now. You can call it a branch or type of marketing in one way, but there is one difference between mainstream digital marketing and growth hacking. The focus of growth hacking is simply growth. It does not focus on selling a single product like marketing does at a time. Growth hacking is supposed to be all about creative tactics and carrying out well-thought-out strategies.
