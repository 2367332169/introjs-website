I'm more than happy to announce that we have released the **Intro.js v3**! This version fixes major issues and adds a lot of new features!

 - Improved the default user-interface and the overall UX. Modern and user-friendly buttons, modal, etc.
 - Added `title` field to the intro steps
 - Fixed the target element position issues (and the `z-index` issues)
 - Improved test coverage
 - And many more minor improvements and bug fixes

Check out the product changelog on https://github.com/usablica/intro.js/releases.

In addition to this major Intro.js release we have also updated our website and documentation!

Big shout out to [Jalal Azimi](https://github.com/jalalazimi) for his amazing work on migrating the Intro.js codebase from legacy JavaScript to ES6 
and [Benjamin J DeLong](https://github.com/bozdoz) for addressing the element `z-index` issues. Thank you folks!
